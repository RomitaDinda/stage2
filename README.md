##How to view
This code is scaffolded with Yeoman and requires that node.js and npm be installed. Please install these first. Additionally, this project depends on a separate project provided by Udacity to create an API end-point. This project is available on [this link](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2). Please follow the instructions there.

Once you have these dependencies installed and the API server is started, do the following:

In the terminal, navigate to this project folder.

run npm install to install project dependencies.

run gulp serve.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000 and explore some restaurants.

In Chrome you can open the Console, go to Application / Service Workers, and then check the Offline option to see offline behavior.
